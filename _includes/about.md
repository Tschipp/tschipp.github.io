### Hi!
I'm Tschipp, I'm a Computer Science student and I make mods in my free time! You might know me
from CarryOn, Animania or any of my other projects!

I have been making mods since 2014, and use Eclipse to make them. I mainly use Forge, altough I
did experiment with Fabric a while ago.
Most of my mods are open source, and you can find them on [GitHub](https://github.com/Tschipp).
I also work on a Bedrock-Marketplace team called the [Razzleberries](https://razzleberri.es/).

If you want to support me and my work, feel free to [donate via Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_donations&business=mrtschipp@gmail.com&lc=US&item_name=Support+me+and+my+work&no_note=0&cn=&currency_code=USD&bn=PP-DonationsBF:btn_donateCC_LG.gif:NonHosted&Z3JncnB0=)!
I am also partnered with [BisectHosting](https://bisecthosting.com/Tschipp), so if you need a server and
