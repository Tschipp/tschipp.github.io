**For MC Forge 1.10.x, 1.11.x, and 1.12.x** 

**As of version 2.0.0, Animania has been split into Addons! To get the Animania Animals that you used to get, you need to download the Farm Addon and the Extra Addon! Additionally, all configs need to be regenerated!**

***Download them here: [Animania Extra Animals - Mods - Minecraft - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/animania-extra), [Animania Farm - Mods - Minecraft - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/animania-farm)***

**What is Animania?**

Animania is an immersive mod that replaces and improves the passive animals in Minecraft, adding multiple breeds, genders, new behaviors, and several new species.

Please note that this mod is still new (so there are bugs). Help us out by reporting issues here: https://github.com/capnkirok/animania/issues

**Improvements include:**

- Better models, textures, and animations
- Proper feed and care of animals
- Improved breeding and more realistic child growth
- More accurate behaviors and actions
- New and better resources and products
- 

**New Behaviors:**

- For animals to be happy, they must have access to a consistent supply of food and water, and in some cases (like Pigs) need a place to have fun (like a mud pit)
- If attacked, some animals will run in fear for an extended period of time and may act more unpredictably near you. Others may attack back (like the Bull).
- If animals do not eat or drink, they become unhappy. They will become weaker, make less noise, and emit smoke particles.
- Animals will only breed or drop their top resources when they are happy, so you are encouraged to take good care of your animals and their environment.
- Animals can be fed and watered using Troughs filled with water, open ponds or rivers, or by hand (with a water bucket)
- Animals will eagerly eat their favorite foods or drink from a water bucket by hand
- 

**See What's Happening:**

- *Please note: on 1.11 and 1.12 versions, the WAILA or TOP mod can display additional information about what's happening in the world, simply by pressing Sneak while viewing animals or blocks. This includes animal information like if they are Hungry, Thirsty, Pregnant, Pregnancy Timer, Ready to Shear, Ready for Milking, Looking for Nest, Wool Regrowth Timer. Block information can include info like Nest Type, RF Generated (Hamster Wheel), and Trough contents and amount remaining.

- 

**Making Friends:**

- The new animals are found all over the overworld, located in different biomes and biome types more accurate to their species and breeds (Animania is fully compatible with Biome Dictionary and mods like Biomes O' Plenty).
- To make friends with animals, simply give them their favorite food. See animal types below to learn more.
- There are achievements/advancements for each breed. Collect them all and win big prizes. Note: Prizes equal the amount of sheer satisfaction you get from accomplishing things in video games.
- New species and breeds will constantly be added to the game.
- All animals can use a lead (you will need it). A simple recipe for Lead has been included in the mod.
- You can easily name animals in the mod. A simple recipe for Name Tags has been included int he mod (String + Gold Nugget)
- 

**Mod Compatibilities:**

- On the 1.11 and 1.12 versions of Animania, there is a strong integration with WAILA, TOP, and JEI, which will give you additional information about your animals and items. We highly recommend using these as companions.
- Moving animals can be done very easily with the Carry On mod (which was developed for Animania originally)
- Animania Cows, Chickens, and Horses, extend the vanilla counterparts and are compatible with Cooking for Blockheads, Hatchery, Astikoor and others.
- Animania is compatible with world generation mods such as Biomes o' Plenty
- The Trough is automatable and can work with other mods that have Pipes such as Immersive Engineering
- Most resources in the game are in OreDictionary and should be compatible with mods like HarvestCraft.
- Vanilla items and resources still drop from Animania mobs in case you need them for other mods. You can also customize the individual drops from any animal in the config.
- Though Animania replaces vanilla animals, this can be also turned off in the config if you want to keep them in game. Animania animals play well will vanilla animals.
