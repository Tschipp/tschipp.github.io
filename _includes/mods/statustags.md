Status Tags adds a new Name Tag for Players. 

What is special about it is that it displays additional information about what the player is doing and it can be seen from up to 128 blocks and through walls.

Note: Despite how it may seem, this is NOT a Client-Only mod. The Server is required to send information about what the players are doing.

 
These are the Status States:

**Idle:**

This is shown anytime a player doesn't do anything special.
