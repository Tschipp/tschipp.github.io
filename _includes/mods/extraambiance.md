Extra Ambiance adds ways of improving the ambiance of a scene

**THIS MOD REQUIRES [TSCHIPPLIB v1.1 and up](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/tschipplib)**

All blocks added by this mod do are not collideable, meaning you can walk right through them.

They are also INVISIBLE. All blocks emit a tiny colored particle, when you're holding one of the Blocks or the Light Editor. If you're not holding any of these items, the blocks also won't show a Hitbox.

Demonstration:
