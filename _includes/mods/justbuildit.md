Just Build It (or JBI for short) adds many unique looking Blocks to your game.

The Blocks are made so that they fit in with vanilla nicely, everything is balanced.

Dyeable Concrete: Me and partially Openblocks

I took some inspiration from the Openblocks mod, which features a canvas that can be

painted in any color. I add a similar Block, Concrete, which can also be painted in any color.

But my mod also adds a variation of said Concrete, namely Concrete Tiles.

These Tiles can also be dyed in separate colors, a picture to explain better:

All this and more awaits you!
